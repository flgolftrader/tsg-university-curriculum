## PART 1: HOOK & INTRODUCTION (5 min)

### Opening Hook [0:00-0:30]
[OPEN ON: Instructor at desk with trading charts behind]

[CAMERA: Medium shot, confident eye contact]

What if I told you that every single stop loss you place...
[PAUSE: 2 seconds]
...is completely visible to the market makers?

And they use that information... to hunt you.

[EMPHASIS: "hunt you" - lean forward, serious tone]

### Learning Outcomes [0:30-1:30]

[ON SCREEN TEXT: TODAY'S LEARNING OUTCOMES]

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

[VISUAL: Bullet points appear one by one]

Number one: [State outcome clearly]
Number two: [State outcome clearly]

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

[GESTURE: Shrug shoulders]

But here's where 95% of retail traders go wrong...

## SCRIPT WRITING BEST PRACTICES

### 1. Write How You Speak
❌ **Wrong**: "It is imperative that traders comprehend the significance of liquidity."
✅ **Right**: "You need to understand why liquidity matters."

### 2. Use Conversational Connectors
- "Now, here's the thing..."
- "Let me show you what I mean..."
- "Think about it this way..."
- "Here's why this is so important..."

### 3. Repeat Key Points 3 Times
1. **Tell them what you'll teach**: "Today we're learning about order blocks"
2. **Teach it**: "An order block is where institutions place large orders"
3. **Tell them what you taught**: "So remember, order blocks show smart money"

### 4. Use The Rule of Three
- Three main points per section
- Three examples per concept
- Three ways to explain difficult ideas

### 5. Create Rhythm With Sentence Length
- Short sentence. Another short one. Then a longer sentence to explain the concept in more detail and give context.
- Back to short. Impact. Power.

### 6. Ask Rhetorical Questions
"Why does this matter? Because 95% of traders ignore this..."
"What does this mean for you? Simple..."
"How do institutions use this? Let me show you..."

## DELIVERY TIPS FOR INSTRUCTOR

- **Enthusiasm**: Genuine excitement about the material
- **Confidence**: Speak with authority (you're the expert)
- **Eye Contact**: Look at camera, not charts

- **Gestures**: Natural, purposeful movements

### Voice Modulation
- **Pitch**: Vary high/low to maintain interest

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ❌ Reading monotone from teleprompter
- ❌ Speaking too fast through complex concepts
- ❌ No pauses or breaks
- ❌ Lack of energy or enthusiasm
- ❌ Too many "ums" and "ahs"
