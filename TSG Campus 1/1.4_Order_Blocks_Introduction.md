## PART 1: HOOK & INTRODUCTION [0:00-5:00] (750 words)

### Opening Hook [0:00-1:00]

[CAMERA: Medium shot, professional lighting]

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

[SERIOUS TONE, direct eye contact]

Pop quiz.

[PAUSE: 1 second]

What's the last candle before a major price move?

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Most traders say: "A breakout candle."

[SHAKE HEAD]

Wrong.

[LEAN FORWARD]

The last candle before a major price move...

is where the institutions placed their orders.

[ON SCREEN TEXT: "Where the money was placed"]

[VISUAL: Chart showing explosive move with order block highlighted at base]

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

That candle... that specific price zone...

has a name.

[PAUSE: 1 second]

We call it an Order Block.

[VISUAL: Order block highlighted and labeled on chart]

And once you learn to identify these zones...

once you understand what they really represent...

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

you'll never look at a chart the same way again.

[VISUAL: Multiple chart examples with order blocks marked]

Welcome to Lesson 1.4: Order Blocks Introduction.

[MUSIC: Energetic, confident]

Where you're going to learn the most powerful support and resistance concept in all of trading.

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Let's begin.

And number four: How to use order blocks in your trading strategy.

[VISUAL: Entry and exit examples on live charts]

Practical entry techniques. Stop placement. Target selection. Complete trade management.

[PERFORMANCE NOTE: Confident, this is the foundation for everything]

### Why This Matters [2:30-5:00]

[CAMERA: Slight zoom in, intimate]

Let me tell you why order blocks matter.

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

In the last lesson, you learned about liquidity.

You learned that institutions hunt stops before making their real move.

[VISUAL: Liquidity sweep example from previous lesson]

But here's the question nobody answers:

[PAUSE: 1 second]

WHERE do institutions place their orders after taking liquidity?

[VISUAL: Question mark on screen]

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

The answer is: Order blocks.

[VISUAL: Liquidity sweep followed by order block formation]

Order blocks are the footprints institutions leave behind.

They're the price zones where banks, hedge funds, and market makers...

placed thousands... sometimes millions... of orders.

[PERFORMANCE NOTE: Let that sink in]

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

And here's why that matters to YOU:

[VISUAL: Support and resistance zones that failed vs order blocks that held]

Traditional support and resistance fails all the time.

Random horizontal lines. Trend lines. Fibonacci levels.

They work sometimes. But they're unreliable.

[PAUSE: 1 second]

Order blocks are different.

[VISUAL: Multiple examples of order blocks holding perfectly]

When you identify a valid order block...

you're identifying where institutions have unfilled orders.

Where they MUST defend the price.

Where they have a vested interest in price reversing.

[PERFORMANCE NOTE: This is the key insight]

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

And that gives you an edge.

A real, quantifiable, tradable edge.

[VISUAL: Win rate statistics on order block trades]

In my trading, order blocks have become my primary entry trigger.

Not moving averages. Not indicators. Not patterns.

Order blocks.

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

By the end of this lesson, they'll become yours too.

Let's get into it.

## PART 2: FOUNDATIONAL CONCEPTS [5:00-15:00] (1,500 words)

### What is an Order Block? [5:00-8:00]

[CAMERA: Medium shot with confidence]

[VISUAL: Clean chart on screen]

Let's start with the definition.

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

An order block is the last UP candle before a significant DOWN move...

or the last DOWN candle before a significant UP move.

[VISUAL: Definition text on screen with visual examples]

[PERFORMANCE NOTE: Slow down for key definition]

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Now, let me break that down because this is critical.

[VISUAL: Bullish order block example]

In an uptrend, price is moving higher.

Then suddenly, you get ONE strong bearish candle.

[VISUAL: Arrow pointing to bearish candle]

One aggressive move down.

[PAUSE: 1 second]

The candle RIGHT BEFORE that bearish candle...

the last bullish candle before the drop...

[VISUAL: Highlight the bullish candle before the drop]

That's your bullish order block.

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Why?

[PAUSE: 1 second]

Because that's where institutions placed their BUY orders.

[VISUAL: Buy order layers within the candle body]

Think about it logically.

For price to aggressively move DOWN...

there had to be aggressive SELLING.

[PAUSE: 1 second]

But before that aggressive selling...

institutions who wanted to go LONG...

had to place their buy orders.

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

And they placed those orders in that last up candle.

[VISUAL: Animated orders filling within the candle]

[PERFORMANCE NOTE: Let them visualize this]

Now here's the important part:

[PAUSE: 1 second]

Not all their orders got filled.

[VISUAL: Partially filled order book]

Price moved too fast.

The market became too aggressive.

[PAUSE: 1 second]

So they have unfilled buy orders sitting in that zone.

[VISUAL: Unfilled orders highlighted in the order block]

And when price returns to that zone...

[VISUAL: Price returning to order block]

those unfilled orders get activated.

Institutions defend their position.

And price bounces.

[VISUAL: Price respecting order block and bouncing]

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

That's an order block.

---

### Bullish vs Bearish Order Blocks [8:00-11:00]

[VISUAL: Split screen - bullish on left, bearish on right]

Let's clarify the two types:

[PAUSE: 1 second]

Bullish Order Blocks.

[VISUAL: Zoom into left side - bullish example]

The last UP candle before a significant DOWN move.

[VISUAL: Chart showing uptrend, final up candle highlighted, then sharp drop]

This represents institutional BUYING.

A zone where banks placed buy orders.

Where they accumulated long positions.

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

When price returns here, we expect:

[VISUAL: List appearing on screen]

- Buying pressure to return
- Price to find support  
- Potential reversal to the upside

[VISUAL: Example of price returning and bouncing]

This is a DEMAND zone.

A place where demand exceeds supply.

---

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Now, Bearish Order Blocks.

[VISUAL: Zoom into right side - bearish example]

The last DOWN candle before a significant UP move.

[VISUAL: Chart showing downtrend, final down candle highlighted, then sharp rally]

This represents institutional SELLING.

A zone where banks placed sell orders.

Where they distributed short positions.

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

When price returns here, we expect:

[VISUAL: List appearing on screen]

- Selling pressure to return
- Price to find resistance
- Potential reversal to the downside

[VISUAL: Example of price returning and rejecting]

This is a SUPPLY zone.

A place where supply exceeds demand.

[PERFORMANCE NOTE: Make sure they understand the symmetry]

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Now here's what most traders get wrong:

[VISUAL: Common mistake highlighted]

They think ANY up candle before a down move is an order block.

[SHAKE HEAD]

No.

[PAUSE: 1 second]

It has to meet specific criteria.

And we're going to cover those criteria right now.

---

### Valid Order Block Criteria [11:00-15:00]

[VISUAL: Checklist appearing on screen]

For an order block to be VALID and tradable, it must meet these requirements:

[PAUSE: 1 second]

Requirement number one: Strong impulse move away from the block.

[VISUAL: Chart showing weak move vs strong impulse]

The candle AFTER the order block must show aggression.

Not a slow drift. Not a gradual move.

An IMPULSE.

[VISUAL: Highlight candle with large body, small wicks]

We want to see:
- Large body relative to recent candles
- Minimal wicks  
- Decisive price action

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Why does this matter?

[PAUSE: 1 second]

Because a strong impulse indicates institutional activity.

[VISUAL: Order flow data showing institutional prints]

It shows that smart money entered aggressively.

That this wasn't retail. This was banks.

[PERFORMANCE NOTE: Emphasize the why behind each rule]

---

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Requirement number two: Clean break of structure.

[VISUAL: Chart showing order block with structure break]

After the order block forms...

price must break a significant swing high or swing low.

[VISUAL: Swing points highlighted]

For a bullish order block:

The down move must break a recent swing low.

[VISUAL: Example showing break of low]

For a bearish order block:

The up move must break a recent swing high.

[VISUAL: Example showing break of high]

[PAUSE: 1 second]

This confirms that the move wasn't just noise.

It was a genuine shift in market structure.

A change in who's in control.

---

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Requirement number three: Fresh, untested zone.

[VISUAL: Chart comparing tested vs untested order blocks]

The best order blocks are ones that price hasn't returned to yet.

[VISUAL: Highlight virgin order block]

We call these "fresh" or "virgin" order blocks.

[PAUSE: 1 second]

Why are fresh blocks better?

[PAUSE: 1 second]

Because all the institutional orders are still there.

[VISUAL: Full order book shown in zone]

Nobody has taken profit yet.

No stops have been triggered.

The orders are still active and waiting.

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Once an order block gets tested once...

[VISUAL: Show order block getting tested]

some of those orders get filled.

Some positions get closed.

The zone becomes weaker.

[VISUAL: Depleted order book]

[PAUSE: 1 second]

Fresh order blocks have the highest probability of holding.

[PERFORMANCE NOTE: This is a key trading edge]

---

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Requirement number four: Respect of higher timeframe context.

[VISUAL: Multiple timeframe analysis]

This is subtle but crucial.

An order block on the 5-minute chart means nothing...

if it contradicts the daily trend.

[VISUAL: Example of 5m order block vs daily trend]

Always check:

[VISUAL: Checklist appearing]

- What's the higher timeframe trend?
- Are there higher timeframe order blocks nearby?
- Does this align with or contradict the bigger picture?

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

The best trades happen when:

Your order block aligns with the higher timeframe direction.

[VISUAL: Multi-timeframe confluence example]

When your 15-minute bullish order block...

sits inside a 4-hour bullish order block...

that sits inside a daily uptrend...

[PAUSE: 1 second]

That's a high-probability setup.

[VISUAL: Winning trade example with multiple timeframe confluence]

Everything is aligned.

All timeframes are in agreement.

That's when you load the boat.

[PERFORMANCE NOTE: Building excitement for high-probability setups]

---

## PART 3: DEEP DIVE & MECHANICS [15:00-30:00] (2,250 words)

### How Order Blocks Form (Institutional Perspective) [15:00-20:00]

[CAMERA: Closer shot, teaching mode]

Now let's go deeper.

Let's understand order blocks from the institution's perspective.

[VISUAL: Institutional trading desk visualization]

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Imagine you're a hedge fund manager.

You need to buy 10 million dollars worth of EUR/USD.

[VISUAL: Large order size shown]

Question: Can you just market buy 10 million all at once?

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

No.

[SHAKE HEAD]

You'd move the market against yourself.

[VISUAL: Slippage chart showing price impact]

You'd get terrible fill prices.

You'd leave footprints that other institutions would exploit.

[PAUSE: 1 second]

So what do you do?

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

You hide your orders.

[VISUAL: Iceberg order visualization]

You break your 10 million dollar order into smaller pieces.

You place limit orders at strategic price levels.

[VISUAL: Layered orders shown on depth chart]

And you wait for price to come to YOU.

[PERFORMANCE NOTE: This is the key institutional behavior]

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Now here's what happens:

[VISUAL: Animated sequence of order filling]

Price is trading in a range.

You identify a good price level to accumulate.

[VISUAL: Price level marked on chart]

You start placing your buy limit orders in that zone.

[VISUAL: Green order blocks appearing in zone]

500K here. 750K there. 1 million at this level.

[PAUSE: 1 second]

But then...

[VISUAL: Large sell order hits the market]

Another institution starts selling aggressively.

[VISUAL: Red candles forming]

Their sell orders are bigger than your buy orders.

Price starts dropping.

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Now you have a decision:

[PAUSE: 1 second]

Do you chase the price down?

[SHAKE HEAD]

No.

That would show your hand.

[PAUSE: 1 second]

Instead, you leave your unfilled orders right where they are.

[VISUAL: Buy orders remaining in the zone as price drops]

You let the market move away.

You wait patiently.

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

And when price eventually returns to your order zone...

[VISUAL: Price retracing back to order block]

Your orders get filled.

[VISUAL: Orders filling animation with green fill notifications]

Automatically.

Passively.

Without moving the market.

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

[LEAN FORWARD]

THAT is an order block.

[VISUAL: Final order block formation with labels]

That last up candle before the drop...

represents YOUR buying zone.

Where YOUR orders are waiting.

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

And when price returns...

you defend your position.

You add to your position.

And that creates the bounce we traders see as "support."

[VISUAL: Order block support example]

[PERFORMANCE NOTE: Make sure they truly understand the mechanism]

---

### Order Block Anatomy [20:00-24:00]

[VISUAL: Detailed order block diagram with labeled parts]

Let's break down the anatomy of an order block.

Understanding the structure helps you trade them more effectively.

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Part one: The wick.

[VISUAL: Zoom into wick of order block candle]

The wick shows where price was rejected.

Where sellers (or buyers) said "too far."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

In a bullish order block, the lower wick is important.

[VISUAL: Highlight lower wick]

This is often where the MOST aggressive buying happened.

Where institutions absorbed all available selling.

[PAUSE: 1 second]

Many traders use the wick low as their entry point.

[VISUAL: Entry marked at wick low]

It's the most conservative, highest-probability zone within the block.

---

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Part two: The body.

[VISUAL: Highlight candle body]

The body represents the battle between bulls and bears.

The open and close show who won that battle.

[PAUSE: 1 second]

For a bullish order block:

The body should be predominantly green (bullish).

[VISUAL: Green bullish candle body]

This shows that buyers were in control during that period.

That institutions were the ones lifting the price.

[PAUSE: 1 second]

The thicker the body...

the more conviction behind the move.

[VISUAL: Comparison of thick vs thin bodies]

Thick bodies = strong institutional interest.

Thin bodies = weak interest, less reliable.

---

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Part three: The high (or low).

[VISUAL: Highlight candle extreme]

For a bullish order block, the high is important.

[VISUAL: Mark high of bullish order block]

This is the "point of control" within the order block.

The last price level before the reversal.

[PAUSE: 1 second]

Some traders use the high as their stop loss reference.

[VISUAL: Stop loss placed above order block high]

The logic: If price breaks back through the high...

the order block has been invalidated.

Institutions didn't defend it.

The orders aren't there.

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

For a bearish order block, we flip this:

[VISUAL: Bearish order block with low marked]

The low becomes the point of control.

Stops go below the low.

[VISUAL: Stop loss below bearish order block low]

---

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Part four: The "mitigation zone."

[VISUAL: Shaded zone showing upper 25% and lower 50% of order block]

This is advanced, but important.

Not all parts of an order block are equal.

[PAUSE: 1 second]

For bullish order blocks:

The bottom 50% is the highest probability zone.

[VISUAL: Lower 50% highlighted in bright green]

This is where the most aggressive buying occurred.

Where institutional orders are densest.

[PAUSE: 1 second]

The top 25% is weaker.

[VISUAL: Upper 25% highlighted in light green]

Price might react here, but it's less reliable.

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Smart traders wait for price to dip into the bottom half.

[VISUAL: Entry examples at bottom 50%]

More conservative traders wait for the low wick.

[VISUAL: Entry at extreme wick low]

The deeper into the order block price goes...

the higher the probability of the reaction.

[PERFORMANCE NOTE: This is nuanced but powerful]

---

### Order Block Invalidation [24:00-27:00]

[VISUAL: Before and after chart showing invalidated order block]

Critical concept: Not all order blocks work forever.

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Order blocks can become INVALID.

And knowing when a block is invalid...

is just as important as knowing when it's valid.

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

[VISUAL: Three scenarios on screen]

An order block becomes invalid when:

---

Scenario one: Full body penetration.

[VISUAL: Chart showing price completely breaking through order block]

If price fully breaks through the body of your order block...

and closes beyond it on the other side...

[VISUAL: Candle close beyond order block]

The block is broken.

[PAUSE: 1 second]

For a bullish order block:

If price closes BELOW the low of the order block candle...

[VISUAL: Example of close below bullish OB]

It's invalid.

The institutions didn't defend it.

The orders got pulled.

Or they got completely filled and there's no more interest.

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Don't try to trade a broken order block.

Move on.

Find a fresh one.

---

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Scenario two: Multiple tests without reaction.

[VISUAL: Chart showing order block getting hit 3-4 times with weak reactions]

If price keeps returning to your order block...

and each time the reaction gets weaker...

[VISUAL: Bounce heights decreasing each time]

The block is depleting.

[PAUSE: 1 second]

Think of it like this:

Each time price hits the block, some orders get filled.

[VISUAL: Order book depleting with each test]

First test: Strong reaction (many orders still there).

Second test: Moderate reaction (some orders filled).

Third test: Weak reaction (most orders gone).

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

After 2-3 tests, the order block loses potency.

The orders are exhausted.

Time to find a new block.

---

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Scenario three: Time decay.

[VISUAL: Calendar showing time passing]

This one is subtle but real.

Order blocks don't last forever.

[PAUSE: 1 second]

Institutions don't leave orders sitting for weeks and months.

They adjust. They cancel. They move them.

[VISUAL: Order modification/cancellation examples]

A fresh order block from yesterday?

Very reliable.

[PAUSE: 1 second]

An order block from 3 weeks ago that hasn't been tested?

Much less reliable.

[VISUAL: Chart showing old vs new order blocks]

The market has moved on.

New information has emerged.

Those orders probably aren't there anymore.

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

My rule: Focus on order blocks less than 5 days old.

[VISUAL: 5-day rule shown on calendar]

Fresher is better.

Newer is stronger.

[PERFORMANCE NOTE: This saves traders from bad entries]

---

### Order Block Trading Psychology [27:00-30:00]

[CAMERA: Intimate, closer shot]

Before we move to practical application...

let's talk about the psychology of trading order blocks.

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Because here's what's going to happen:

[VISUAL: Chart with order block marked]

You're going to identify a perfect order block.

All criteria met.

Fresh zone.

Strong impulse away.

Great higher timeframe context.

[PAUSE: 1 second]

And price is going to drop RIGHT into your block.

[VISUAL: Animated price approaching order block]

And you're going to feel fear.

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

[PERFORMANCE NOTE: Vulnerable, honest tone]

You're going to think:

"What if it breaks?"

"What if the institutions aren't there anymore?"

"What if this time is different?"

[VISUAL: Fear-based thoughts appearing on screen]

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

And in that moment of fear...

retail traders close their charts.

They don't take the trade.

[VISUAL: Red X over the order block]

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

But professional traders?

[VISUAL: Green checkmark and entry arrow]

They click buy.

[PAUSE: 1 second]

Why?

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Because they understand something fundamental:

[LEAN FORWARD]

The best entries FEEL wrong.

[ON SCREEN TEXT: "The best entries feel wrong"]

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

When price is at an order block...

it's at a local extreme.

[VISUAL: Price at order block low]

It LOOKS like it's breaking down.

It FEELS like it's going lower.

The momentum is bearish.

[VISUAL: Bear emoji and downward arrows]

[PAUSE: 1 second]

And that's exactly when you want to buy.

[VISUAL: Buy arrow and green entry]

Because that's when retail is panicking.

That's when weak hands are selling.

And that's when institutions are buying.

[VISUAL: Smart money vs dumb money comparison]

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

So here's your mental framework:

[VISUAL: Mental framework appearing]

If the order block is valid...

If the criteria are met...

If the setup is there...

[PAUSE: 1 second]

Take the trade.

[PAUSE: 1 second]

Even if it feels uncomfortable.

ESPECIALLY if it feels uncomfortable.

[PERFORMANCE NOTE: Empowering, confidence-building]

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

That discomfort is your edge.

That's what separates you from retail.

[VISUAL: Profitable trade result from uncomfortable entry]

Get comfortable being uncomfortable.

That's where the money is made.

## PART 4: PRACTICAL APPLICATION [30:00-38:00] (1,200 words)

### Step-by-Step Order Block Identification [30:00-34:00]

[CAMERA: Screen share mode, live chart]

Alright, let's make this practical.

I'm going to show you my exact step-by-step process...

for identifying and trading order blocks.

[VISUAL: Clean EUR/USD 15-minute chart]

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Step one: Identify the trend on a higher timeframe.

[VISUAL: Switch to 4-hour chart]

Before I look for order blocks on the 15-minute...

I check the 4-hour chart.

[PAUSE: 1 second]

Is price in an uptrend? Downtrend? Range?

[VISUAL: Highlight trend direction with arrows]

In this example, we have a clear 4-hour uptrend.

[VISUAL: Circle higher highs and higher lows]

So I'm looking for BULLISH order blocks to trade WITH the trend.

[PERFORMANCE NOTE: Always start with higher timeframe context]

---

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Step two: Drop to the trading timeframe.

[VISUAL: Switch to 15-minute chart]

Now I'm on the 15-minute chart.

And I'm looking for the most recent impulsive move.

[PAUSE: 1 second]

Here, I see price made a strong push higher.

[VISUAL: Highlight bullish impulse leg]

Then it started to retrace.

[VISUAL: Highlight retracement]

Perfect. That retracement is likely coming back to an order block.

---

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Step three: Find the last opposite-colored candle before the impulse.

[VISUAL: Scan back to find last bearish candle before bullish impulse]

I scan backwards from the impulse...

looking for the last DOWN candle before price exploded UP.

[PAUSE: 1 second]

There.

[VISUAL: Highlight the bearish candle]

That bearish candle right before the bullish explosion.

That's my order block candidate.

---

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Step four: Verify the impulse quality.

[VISUAL: Zoom into candles after order block]

I check the candle that moved away from my order block.

[PAUSE: 1 second]

Is it a strong bullish candle?

[VISUAL: Highlight large green candle]

Yes. Large body. Small wicks. Aggressive.

[VISUAL: Checkmark appears]

This confirms institutional interest.

---

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Step five: Check if structure was broken.

[VISUAL: Mark swing low that was broken]

After the order block formed...

did price break a recent swing low?

[PAUSE: 1 second]

Yes, right here.

[VISUAL: Circle the broken swing low]

Price broke below this previous low...

then reversed hard back up.

[VISUAL: Checkmark appears]

This confirms the order block created a shift in market structure.

---

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Step six: Mark the order block zone.

[VISUAL: Draw horizontal lines at high and low of order block candle]

I mark the high and low of my order block candle.

[VISUAL: Shaded zone between the lines]

This is my zone of interest.

Where I expect price to react.

[PAUSE: 1 second]

I also mark the bottom 50% in a brighter color.

[VISUAL: Bottom half shaded brighter]

This is my premium entry zone.

---

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Step seven: Wait for price to return.

[VISUAL: Forward playback of price returning to order block]

Now I wait.

[PAUSE: 1 second]

Price is currently retracing.

It's coming back down toward my order block.

[VISUAL: Price approaching order block zone]

I don't chase.

I don't predict.

I wait for price to enter my zone.

[PERFORMANCE NOTE: Patience is critical]

---

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Step eight: Confirm entry with price action.

[VISUAL: Price enters order block, starts to react]

Price enters the bottom 50% of my order block.

[VISUAL: Zoom into reaction]

And I see a bullish engulfing candle form.

[VISUAL: Highlight bullish engulfing pattern]

This is my confirmation.

[VISUAL: Green entry arrow]

I enter LONG.

---

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Step nine: Set stop loss.

[VISUAL: Stop loss line appearing]

My stop goes below the low of the order block.

[VISUAL: Stop placed 5 pips below OB low]

Usually 5-10 pips below for buffer.

[PAUSE: 1 second]

If price trades below the order block low...

the block is invalid.

I'm wrong.

I take the small loss and move on.

---

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Step ten: Set take profit targets.

[VISUAL: Multiple TP levels appearing]

I typically use two targets:

Target one: Recent swing high.

[VISUAL: TP1 marked at swing high]

Target two: Next order block or liquidity level.

[VISUAL: TP2 marked at bearish order block above]

[PAUSE: 1 second]

I take partial profit at TP1.

[VISUAL: Exit 50% of position]

Move my stop to breakeven.

[VISUAL: Stop moved to entry]

And let the rest run to TP2.

[VISUAL: Final profit result shown]

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

That's the complete process.

Ten steps. Every single trade.

[PERFORMANCE NOTE: Make it feel systematic and repeatable]

---

### Common Entry Techniques [34:00-38:00]

[VISUAL: Three entry techniques side by side]

Let me show you three ways to enter order block trades.

Each has different risk-reward profiles.

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Technique one: The Limit Order Approach.

[VISUAL: Chart with limit order placed in order block]

You identify your order block.

You place a buy limit order at the bottom 50% of the zone.

[VISUAL: Limit order line in lower half of OB]

And you wait.

[PAUSE: 1 second]

Pros:

[VISUAL: Pros list appearing]

- You get the best possible entry price
- You don't have to watch the charts
- Removes emotion from the entry

Cons:

[VISUAL: Cons list appearing]

- Sometimes price doesn't reach your limit
- You might miss the trade
- No confirmation of the reaction

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

I use this approach when:

I have very high confidence in the order block.

Multiple timeframe confluence.

Fresh zone.

Strong setup.

[VISUAL: High-confidence setup example]

I set my limit and let the market come to me.

---

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Technique two: The Confirmation Approach.

[VISUAL: Chart showing entry after confirmation candle]

You wait for price to enter the order block...

and then you wait for a confirmation candle.

[PAUSE: 1 second]

Confirmation candles include:

[VISUAL: Examples of each appearing]

- Bullish engulfing
- Hammer or pin bar at the zone
- Strong bullish close after wick into zone

[PAUSE: 1 second]

Once you see confirmation...

you enter on the CLOSE of that candle.

[VISUAL: Entry arrow at candle close]

Or on the open of the next candle.

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Pros:

[VISUAL: Pros list appearing]

- Higher probability (you have confirmation)
- More confidence in the trade
- Reduces false entries

Cons:

[VISUAL: Cons list appearing]

- Slightly worse entry price
- Smaller risk-reward ratio
- Requires active chart monitoring

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

I use this approach when:

I'm less confident in the order block.

Or when I'm trading a higher timeframe.

Or when I want confirmation before committing capital.

[VISUAL: Confirmation examples on various pairs]

This is the most common approach for most traders.

---

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Technique three: The Scalper's Approach.

[VISUAL: Lower timeframe chart with order block]

You identify an order block on a higher timeframe.

Then you drop to a much lower timeframe.

[VISUAL: Timeframe comparison - 1H order block, drop to 1-minute chart]

And you wait for micro-structure to confirm the reaction.

[PAUSE: 1 second]

For example:

You have a 1-hour bullish order block.

[VISUAL: 1H order block marked]

Price enters the zone.

You drop to the 1-minute chart.

[VISUAL: Switch to 1-minute chart]

You wait for a break of structure on the 1-minute.

[VISUAL: 1-minute break of structure marked]

Then you enter.

[VISUAL: Entry arrow on 1-minute chart]

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Pros:

[VISUAL: Pros list appearing]

- Very tight stop loss
- Excellent risk-reward
- Quick feedback on if you're right or wrong

Cons:

[VISUAL: Cons list appearing]

- Requires intense focus
- More screen time
- Higher skill level needed

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

I use this approach when:

I'm actively trading.

I want to maximize risk-reward.

Or when the higher timeframe stop would be too large for my risk tolerance.

[PERFORMANCE NOTE: Show that all three approaches are valid]

## PART 5: EXERCISES & PRACTICE [38:00-43:00] (750 words)

### Exercise 1: Order Block Identification Challenge [38:00-40:00]

[VISUAL: Chart with multiple price swings]

Alright, let's test your knowledge.

I'm going to show you a chart.

[PAUSE: 1 second]

Your job: Identify ALL valid bullish order blocks.

[VISUAL: EUR/USD 15-minute chart with 20 candles]

[PAUSE: 3 seconds]

Take a moment. Look at the chart.

Where are the order blocks?

[PAUSE: 5 seconds]

[PERFORMANCE NOTE: Give them time to actually look]

Okay, let's review.

[VISUAL: First order block highlighted]

Order block number one: Right here.

[PAUSE: 1 second]

Why is this valid?

[VISUAL: Checklist appearing]

- Last up candle before strong down move ✓
- Strong bearish impulse away ✓
- Broke structure below ✓
- Fresh zone ✓

[VISUAL: Second order block highlighted]

Order block number two: Here.

Same criteria met.

[VISUAL: Third potential block with X over it]

Now, what about this one?

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

This is NOT a valid order block.

Why?

[PAUSE: 1 second]

The impulse away was weak.

[VISUAL: Show weak candles after the potential OB]

Just a slow drift, not an explosive move.

No institutional footprint.

Not valid.

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Did you catch that?

The difference between a slow move and an impulse is critical.

[VISUAL: Side-by-side comparison of weak vs strong impulse]

Practice this distinction.

It will save you from countless bad trades.

### Exercise 2: Entry Planning Drill [40:00-43:00]

[VISUAL: New chart with clear order block]

Exercise two: Entry planning.

[PAUSE: 1 second]

I'm giving you a perfect order block setup.

[VISUAL: Bullish order block clearly marked]

Here's your order block.

Price is approaching from above.

[VISUAL: Animated price moving toward OB]

Your job: Plan the complete trade.

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Where would you enter?

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Where would you place your stop?

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Where would you take profit?

[PAUSE: 3 seconds]

[PERFORMANCE NOTE: Let them think through the trade]

Alright, here's my plan:

[VISUAL: Trade plan appearing on chart]

Entry: Bottom 50% of the order block with confirmation.

[VISUAL: Entry zone shaded and marked]

Specifically, I'd wait for a bullish engulfing or hammer at this zone.

[VISUAL: Confirmation pattern example]

Stop loss: 10 pips below the order block low.

[VISUAL: Stop loss line appearing]

This gives me room for wick and spread.

If price closes below the block, I'm out.

[PAUSE: 1 second]

Take profit one: Recent swing high, right here.

[VISUAL: TP1 marked]

This is a 1:2 risk-reward.

I'd close 50% of the position.

[PAUSE: 1 second]

Take profit two: Next bearish order block above.

[VISUAL: TP2 marked at bearish OB]

This is a 1:4 risk-reward.

I'd let the remaining 50% run here.

[VISUAL: Full trade plan shown with R:R ratios]

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

This is how you plan trades BEFORE entering.

[VISUAL: Planning checklist]

Never enter a trade without knowing:
- Your entry price
- Your stop loss
- Your targets
- Your position size

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Do this exercise on your own charts.

[VISUAL: Practice instructions]

Find 10 order blocks.

Plan 10 complete trades.

Write down your entry, stop, and targets for each.

[PAUSE: 1 second]

Then forward-test them.

[VISUAL: Forward testing demonstration]

Watch what happens.

Did price respect the order block?

Would your entry have triggered?

Would you have hit stop or target?

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

This is how you develop pattern recognition.

This is how you build confidence.

[PERFORMANCE NOTE: Encourage them to actually do this]

Not by watching more videos.

By doing the work yourself.

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Alright, let's move to the summary.

## PART 6: SUMMARY & KEY TAKEAWAYS [43:00-47:00] (600 words)

### Core Concepts Recap [43:00-45:00]

[CAMERA: Return to host, confident and clear]

Let's recap what you've learned today.

[VISUAL: Lesson title card]

Lesson 1.4: Order Blocks Introduction.

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Key concept one: Order blocks are institutional footprints.

[VISUAL: Order block with institutional orders shown]

They represent zones where banks and hedge funds placed large orders.

These aren't random candles.

They're the last candle before a major move...

where smart money positioned themselves.

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Key concept two: Valid order blocks have specific criteria.

[VISUAL: Criteria checklist]

- Strong impulse move away
- Clean break of structure
- Fresh, untested zone
- Higher timeframe alignment

[PAUSE: 1 second]

Don't trade every candle as an order block.

Be selective.

Quality over quantity.

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Key concept three: Order blocks can be bullish or bearish.

[VISUAL: Bullish and bearish examples side by side]

Bullish blocks: Last UP candle before DOWN move (demand zones).

Bearish blocks: Last DOWN candle before UP move (supply zones).

[PAUSE: 1 second]

They're mirror images of each other.

Same logic. Opposite direction.

---

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Key concept four: Order blocks become invalid.

[VISUAL: Invalidation scenarios]

When price fully penetrates the block...

or when it's been tested multiple times...

or when too much time has passed...

[PAUSE: 1 second]

The block is dead.

Move on to a fresh one.

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Key concept five: The best entries feel uncomfortable.

[VISUAL: Entry at order block looking scary]

When price is at an order block...

it looks like it's breaking down.

[PAUSE: 1 second]

That discomfort is your edge.

That's when retail is wrong and institutions are right.

[PERFORMANCE NOTE: Reinforce the psychology]

---

### Critical Mistakes to Avoid [45:00-47:00]

[VISUAL: Warning sign]

Before we finish, let me give you three critical mistakes to avoid:

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Mistake one: Trading every order block.

[VISUAL: Chart with too many OBs marked]

Not all order blocks are created equal.

[PAUSE: 1 second]

Just because a candle meets the technical definition...

doesn't mean you should trade it.

[PAUSE: 1 second]

Look for:
- Higher timeframe confluence
- Fresh zones
- Strong impulse
- Clear structure breaks

[VISUAL: High-quality OB example with all criteria]

Be patient. Wait for A+ setups.

---

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Mistake two: Ignoring invalidation.

[VISUAL: Trader holding losing position]

If price breaks through your order block...

if it closes beyond the zone...

[PAUSE: 1 second]

GET OUT.

[VISUAL: Red exit arrow]

Don't hold and hope.

Don't average down.

Don't tell yourself "it's coming back."

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

The order block is broken.

The institutions didn't defend it.

The setup is invalid.

Take the small loss and move to the next trade.

[PERFORMANCE NOTE: Firm, protective tone]

---

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Mistake three: No higher timeframe context.

[VISUAL: 5-minute chart zoomed in]

This is the biggest mistake I see:

Traders find a perfect 5-minute order block...

and completely ignore that the daily trend is opposite.

[VISUAL: Zoom out to show daily trend contradicting 5m OB]

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Always check the higher timeframe.

[VISUAL: Multi-timeframe analysis]

A 15-minute bullish order block in a 4-hour downtrend...

is a low-probability trade.

[PAUSE: 1 second]

The best trades have alignment across timeframes.

[VISUAL: All timeframes aligned example]

When your order block trades WITH the higher timeframe trend...

your win rate skyrockets.

[VISUAL: High win rate statistics]

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Remember: The higher timeframe always wins.

[PERFORMANCE NOTE: Final strong point]

## PART 7: NEXT STEPS & CLOSING [47:00-50:00] (450 words)

### What's Coming Next [47:00-48:00]

[CAMERA: Excited energy, forward-looking]

Alright, you've just learned order blocks.

[PAUSE: 1 second]

This is one of the most powerful concepts in trading.

But we're just getting started.

[VISUAL: Course roadmap appearing]

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

In the next lesson, Lesson 1.5...

we're going to learn Auction Market Theory.

[VISUAL: Lesson 1.5 preview card]

You're going to learn:

[VISUAL: List appearing]

- How the market functions as an auction
- The concept of fair value and value areas
- Why price rotates between extremes
- How to identify when price is likely to reverse

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

And here's why this matters:

[VISUAL: Order block + Auction theory diagram]

Auction Market Theory will give you the CONTEXT for order blocks.

[PAUSE: 1 second]

You'll understand not just WHERE order blocks are...

but WHEN they're likely to be tested.

When the auction is driving price back to value.

[VISUAL: Price returning to value zone with order blocks marked]

It's going to complete your understanding of how markets really work.

[PERFORMANCE NOTE: Build anticipation]

---

### Action Steps [48:00-49:30]

[VISUAL: Action steps checklist]

Before you move to the next lesson, here's your homework:

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Action step one: Find 20 order blocks on your charts.

[VISUAL: Chart scanning demonstration]

Use any timeframe. Any pair.

Mark bullish and bearish order blocks.

[PAUSE: 1 second]

Write down why each one is valid:
- What was the impulse?
- What structure broke?
- Is the zone fresh?

[VISUAL: Example of written analysis]

This trains your eye.

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Action step two: Plan 5 complete trades.

[VISUAL: Trade planning template]

Pick 5 of your best order blocks.

Plan:
- Entry price or trigger
- Stop loss level  
- Take profit targets
- Risk-reward ratio

[PAUSE: 1 second]

Do this BEFORE price gets there.

This is how you think like a professional.

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Action step three: Track your order blocks for one week.

[VISUAL: Tracking spreadsheet]

Don't place real trades yet.

Just mark your order blocks.

Watch what happens when price returns.

[PAUSE: 1 second]

Did they hold?

Did they break?

What was the win rate?

[VISUAL: Results analysis]

This gives you confidence in the concept.

Confidence based on YOUR data.

Not just my teaching.

[PERFORMANCE NOTE: Empower them to verify for themselves]

### Closing [49:30-50:00]

[CAMERA: Close, personal, confident]

Order blocks are going to change your trading.

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

They changed mine.

[PAUSE: 1 second]

Once you see them, you can't unsee them.

[VISUAL: Multiple charts with order blocks highlighted]

They're on every chart.

Every timeframe.

Every market.

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

And now you know how to find them.

How to validate them.

How to trade them.

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

Put in the work.

[LEAN FORWARD]

Do the exercises.

Track your blocks.

Build your confidence.

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

And I'll see you in Lesson 1.5...

where we dive into Auction Market Theory.

[PAUSE: 1 second]

Let's go.
