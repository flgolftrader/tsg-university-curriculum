## üìù SCRIPT EXPANSION PROCESS

### How to Turn Outlines into Full Scripts

#### Step 1: Review the Outline (15 minutes)
- Read the 500-1000 word outline
- Understand the lesson objectives
- Note key concepts and examples
- Review production notes

#### Step 2: Expand Each Section (3-4 hours per lesson)

**Part 1: Hook & Introduction** (Outline: 100 words ‚Üí Script: 750 words)
- Expand opening hook into dramatic 45-second opener
- Add camera directions and visual cues
- Expand learning outcomes with context
- Add "why this matters" emotional connection
- Include lesson roadmap with specifics

**Example Expansion**:

*Outline says*: "Hook: Why does price gravitate to certain levels?"

*Full script becomes*:
```
[CAMERA: Close up on instructor, dramatic lighting]

Have you ever noticed something strange about price?

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

It doesn't just move randomly.

[STAND UP, walk to chart]

It seems to... remember things.

[POINT to chart]

Look at this. Price comes back to this level. Again. And again.

[CIRCLE the level]

Why?

[PAUSE: 3 seconds]

[LOOK at camera, lean forward]

Because this is where institutions are positioned.

This is where the REAL money wants to do business.

And today, I'm going to show you exactly how to identify these levels...

before anyone else sees them.

[MUSIC: Dramatic reveal]

Welcome to Lesson X.X...
```

**Part 2-7**: Follow same expansion process
- Take each bullet point
- Expand into 2-4 sentences
- Add examples and analogies
- Include camera directions
- Mark pauses and emphasis
- Hit word count targets for each part

#### Step 3: Add Production Elements (30 minutes)
- Insert all camera directions
- Note visual graphics needed
- Mark B-roll suggestions
- Add music cues
- Include editing notes

#### Step 4: Quality Review (30 minutes)
- Read aloud at 150 wpm pace
- Does it hit target duration?
- Is it conversational and engaging?
- Are concepts explained clearly?
- Does it follow the template structure?

**Total Time Per Script**: 4-5 hours
**At 310 scripts needed**: 1,240-1,550 hours of writing
**With 3 writers**: ~420-520 hours each (10-13 weeks at 40 hrs/week)
